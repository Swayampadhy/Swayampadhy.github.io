Upon detonation of malware we get this output in wireshark-

![[Pasted image 20230805195322.png]]
We get a request for the DNS address - `ec2-3-109-20-24-srv3.local`
![[Pasted image 20230805195513.png]]
We point that DNS address to remnux using <span style="color:#047c3a">hosts file</span>.
It tries to get a favicon.ico from that address.

This is definitely a remote access trojan.

# Conclusion
---
This go binary is a remote access trojan. When run it creates a connection and gets the favicon.ico from `ec2-3-109-20-24-srv3.local` and runs it. This in turn creates a reverse shell to the attacker.
