This vbs script is decoding the two crt files and writing them to `C:\Users\Public\Documents\` .
After running the vbs file,we look onto the contents of `C:\Users\Public\Documents`.

Two files - one.vbs and xml.xml have been created.

We see a shellcode in the xml file.
After de-obfuscating the vbs file, we get-
![[Pasted image 20230804232956.png]]
So this file uses <span style="color:#ffff00">MSBuild.exe</span> to run the xml.xml file in a hidden window with runas(the file will be run as Administrator).So the shellcode in the xml file will be run.

After detonating the vbs script , it can be seen that the shellcode in the xml file creates a user to the remote users and Administrator groups. After that it opens up RDP .

# Conclusion
----
The malicious vbs script creates a vbs and xml file and when run it creates an admin remote user. The attacker then can logon as that user and can pwn the machine.
