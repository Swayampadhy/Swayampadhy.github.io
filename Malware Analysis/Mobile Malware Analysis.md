# Analysis

Android Malware must be analysed in the<span style="color:#ffff00"> mobsf framework</span> inside remnux.

Start Mobsf using-

		docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-   framework-mobsf:latest

Now as the framework is running in a docker container, dynamic analysis won't be available to us. So we can only perform static analysis.

After Mobsf has started , navigate to `localhost:8000` using a web browser and we are greeted with the mobsf dashboard.
