# Static Analysis
---
As Flubot is an android malware, <span style="color:#047c3a">mobsf framework</span> is used for analysis purposes.
Moreover as mobsf is emulated in a docker environment, we are unable to perform dynamic analysis. Thus only static analysis will be performed.

We start mobsf framework using - 

		docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-   framework-mobsf:latest

We drag and drop the armed apk inside the browser window.After some time the analysis is done and we see the results.

We submit the file's hash to virus-total and it comes back as malicious.

This malware is written in java.

There are two endpoints that the malware connects to-

They both have the same domain name,most probrably originating from China.

Now looking at the source code-

In the com folder, we see a lot of different app names.
![[Pasted image 20230806235701.png]]We also see a `DispatchingAndroidInjector.java` file. So this malware must be injecting malicious processes into legitimate apps.
